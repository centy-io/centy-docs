# Demo Mode

Try Centy without installing anything. Demo mode lets you explore all the features with sample data.

## Try It Now

**[Launch Demo](https://app.centy.io/?demo=true)**

No account or installation required - just click and explore.

## What's Included

The demo comes pre-loaded with sample data so you can see Centy in action:

- **7 sample issues** - Various statuses (open, in-progress, closed, for-validation)
- **3 documentation pages** - Getting Started, API Reference, Contributing Guide
- **3 pull requests** - Open and merged examples
- **3 team members** - Alice Developer, Bob Engineer, Charlie Designer
- **Custom fields** - See how to extend issues with additional metadata

## What You Can Do

In demo mode you can:

- Browse issues and documentation
- View issue details and metadata
- Explore the project structure
- Navigate between different views
- See how custom fields work

## Limitations

Demo mode uses local sample data, so some features are restricted:

- Changes are not persisted (they reset on refresh)
- Cannot create or modify issues
- Asset management is disabled
- No daemon connection required

When you're ready to use Centy with your own projects:
